% for now, ignoring the "first turn stuff off; then turn stuff on" idea. will come back to this later.
% one set of cases for *each contactor*, which decides the contactor's position based on the generator statuses.

%List of cases where each contactor is on. (else off)

[GL AL AR GR] = input %input a length-4 vector of signals

%B1 (power for GL) is on if...
    GL works

%B2 (power from AL) is on if... 
    AL works, everything else is broken
    AL works, GL is broken, GR works 
    AL works, GL works, GR is broken, AR is broken
    GL is broken, GR is broken, AL works %I'm saying AL is preferable to AR if both GL and GR are broken. this is arbitrary.

%B3 (power for AR) is on if...
    AR works, everything else is broken
    AR works, GL works, GR is broken
    AR works, GR works, GL is broken, AL is broken 

%B4 (power for GR) is on if...
    GR works

%B5 is on if...
    GL is broken
    GL works and everything else is broken

%B6 is on if...
    GR is broken
    GR works an everything else is broken
